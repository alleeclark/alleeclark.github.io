      <p>Why do we fail at what we set out to do in teh world. One reason, they observed is &ldquo;neccessary fallibility&rdquo;- &ndash;some things we want to do are simply beyond our capacity. We are not omniscient or all powerful. Even ehanced by techology, our physical and mental powers are limited. Many things will remain outside our understanding and control.</p>

<p>We have jut two reasons that we may nonethess fail.</p>

<p>First is ignorance &ndash; we may err because sciencce has givenis only a partial understanding of the world and how it works.</p>

<p>second type of failure the philosophers call ineptiude&ndash; because in these insttances the knowledge exist, yet we fail to apply it correctly.</p>

<p>note &ndash; give examples of things we dont know exists yet.</p>

<p>he talks about how science has filled in enough knowedled to make ineptitude as much our struggle as ignorance.</p>

<p>inepitude vs epitude??
making sure we apply the knowledge we have consistently and correctly. Making the right decision might be difficult.</p>

<p>Studies found at least 30 percent of patients with stroke recieve incomplete or inappropiate care from their doctors, as do 45 eprcent of patients with asthma and 60 percent of patiences with pneumonia.</p>

<p>failures carry an emotional valence that seems to cloud how we think about them. faulures of ignorance we can forgive. If the knowledge of the best thing to do in a given situation does not exist, we are happy to hav epeople simply make theur best effor. But if knowedlge exist and is not applied correctly, it is difficult not to be infuriated.</p>

<p>Degrees if cinokexuty though, and medicine an dother fields like it have grown so far beyond the usual kind that avoiding daily mistakes is proving impossible even for our most superspecialised.</p>

<p>Ameircans today undergo an average of 7 ops in their lifetime. surgeons performing more than 50 million operations anually. Upwards of 150k death following sugeries more than 3 times of road traffic fatalities. least half of deaths major complications are avoidable.</p>

<p>In a complex environment, experts are up against two main difficulutes.</p>

<p>the first is the fallibility of human memory and attention, especially when it comes to mudance, rountine matters that are easily overlooked under the strain of more pressing events. People might skip stepsn even when they remember them.</p>

<p>Checklist seems to provide protection against such failures. They remind ys of the minimun neccessary steps and make them explicit.</p>

<p>Once an ICU implemented a checklist The proportion of patients not recieving the reccommended care dropped from 70 percent ot 4 percent the occurence of pneumonias fell by a quarter and 21 fewer patients died than in the previous year.. Impoved the consistence to the point that the average lenght of patient stay in intensive care dropped by half.</p>

<p>They provide a kind of cognitive net. They catch mental flaws inherent in all of us &ndash; flaws of memory and attention and throughness.</p>

<p>Checklist are limited to complex and unique problems.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t remember everything</p>

<p>commication task as well aklows to take other concerns in to account
sometimes the biggest error is the error of communication</p>

<p>Another limitation is that some checkclist take months to complete but in incidents checklist need to get completed in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>rountine checklist to be peformed everyday and on-normal chcklist covering ever concievalbe emergency situation.</p>

<p>What not to tinker with when.</p>

<p>Good a bad checklist
Bad checklist are vauge and imprecise. They are oto long, hard to use and impractical. Treat people who are using hte tools as dumb and try to spell out every single step.</p>

<p>Good checklist on the other hand are precise. Efficent to the point and easy to use even in the most difficult sitionations. Dont try to spell everything out. A checklist can not solve an incident. Instead they provide reminderse of only the most critical important steps &ndash; the ones that even highly skilled could miss.</p>

<p>Checklist are no means perfect confusing unclear or flawed.</p>

<p>When writing a checklist you have to make key decisions</p>

<ul>
<li>Define a clear pause point at whcih the checklist is supposed to be used.</li>
<li>DO-Confirm checklist

<ul>
<li>members can peform the task from memory experience but when they stop its something they can go back to and verify everything was done</li>
</ul></li>
<li>READ-DO

<ul>
<li>carry out task as you check them off like a recipie.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try to keep them between 5 to 9 items.</li>
<li>Use familiar language</li>
<li>Simple in exact</li>
<li>Free of clutter and uneeded colors</li>
<li>They are not how to guides</li>
</ul>
