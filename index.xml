      <description>I believe ttrpc stands for teeny tiny rpc. Don&amp;rsquo;t quote me on it. Created for low latency environments based off of the famous gRPC. I was introduced by ttrpc in a talk given by a containerD maintainer. Unexpected for you to know how containerD functions to get started with ttrpc.
This guide is aimed for developers who know gRPC and would like to get started with ttrpc. Knowledge of gRPC isn&amp;rsquo;t required, however knowledge of golang and tcp is needed.</description>

      <description>More than likely I am a Microsoft developer tool advocate. My first language was c++ using Visual Studio. Haven’t stopped sipping the kool aid since. Even though my primary language is golang today
Bookmarks Same principle as your web browser. Keep track of places in the code that you know you will need to come back to.
Pros:

      <description>This is mainly written from a production engineer’s view. This might be helpful for an engineer who is response for some production service, and just wants a sanity check&amp;hellip; On with the question. Sometimes you have legacy software that most of your company’s critical path relies on. That software hasn&amp;rsquo;t powered off in X amount of scary years. Some combination of documentation, automation of task and source control code is nonexistent.</description>

      <description>Today I was updating an ansible playbook that needed to perform some system level cleanups on a periodic basis. In the past my team used straight up crons. Sometimes we’ve used monit to perform checks on these crons for restart. Mainly we were on centos 6 host. Now we are on Centos 7 and have the ability to use systemD. Systemd has a time configuration that you may use to run crons.</description>
