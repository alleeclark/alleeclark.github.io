      <description>This is mainly written from a production engineer’s view. This might be helpful for an engineer who is response for some production service, and just wants a sanity check&amp;hellip; On with the question. Sometimes you have legacy software that most of your company’s critical path relies on. That software hasn&amp;rsquo;t powered off in X amount of scary years. Some combination of documentation, automation of task and source control code is nonexistent.</description>

      <description>Today I was updating an ansible playbook that needed to perform some system level cleanups on a periodic basis. In the past my team used straight up crons. Sometimes we’ve used monit to perform checks on these crons for restart. Mainly we were on centos 6 host. Now we are on Centos 7 and have the ability to use systemD. Systemd has a time configuration that you may use to run crons.</description>
