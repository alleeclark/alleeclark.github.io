      <description>This is mainly written from a production engineer’s view. This might be helpful for an engineer who is response for some production service, and just wants a sanity check&amp;hellip; On with the question. Sometimes you have legacy software that most of your company’s critical path relies on. That software hasn&amp;rsquo;t powered off in X amount of scary years. Some combination of documentation, automation of task and source control code is nonexistent.</description>

      <description>I am Allee. Currently an SRE at Oscar Health. Before this I was working on and with data science teams at Dell. Built and supported highly avaiable search clusters for machine learning logs. I am a product of an HBCU. Being culuturally reposible is very important to me. I love cooking. I treat cookbooks like textbooks and hope to publish some day.
I&amp;rsquo;ll likely ramble about a few things here or there.</description>
