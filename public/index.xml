      <description>I am Allee. Currently an SRE at Oscar Health. Before this I was working on and with data science teams at Dell. Built and supported highly avaiable search clusters for machine learning logs. I am a product of an HBCU. Being culuturally reposible is very important to me. I love cooking. I treat cookbooks like textbooks and hope to publish some day.
I&amp;rsquo;ll likely ramble about a few things here or there.</description>
