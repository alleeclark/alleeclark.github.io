I am Allee. Currently an SRE at Oscar Health. Before this I was working on and with data science teams at Dell. Built and supported highly avaiable search clusters for machine learning logs. I am a product of an HBCU. Being culuturally reposible is very important to me. I love cooking. I treat cookbooks like textbooks and hope to publish some day.

I'll likely ramble about a few things here or there. Share technical thoughts and post reviews of books and conferences.
